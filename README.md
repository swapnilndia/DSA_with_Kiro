# DSA Mastery Roadmap - JavaScript

A comprehensive roadmap to master Data Structures and Algorithms with deep topic knowledge and 300+ problems.

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy
**Quality over Quantity** - Master each topic completely before moving to the next. Each topic has 50-100+ problems for thorough understanding.

## 📚 Complete Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 months)

   - Current: 1/75+ completed

2. **[Strings](./Strings/README.md)** - 60+ problems  
   - Pattern matching, sliding window, KMP, trie applications
   - Status: Coming next

3. **[Linked Lists](./Linked-Lists/README.md)** - 40+ problems
   - Traversal, reversal, cycle detection, merging
   - Status: Coming next

### Phase 2: Core Data Structures (2-3 months)

## 📊 Overall Progress
- **Total Problems**: 600+ across all topics
- **Current Progress**: 1/600+ (0.2%)
- **Active Topic**: Arrays (1/75+)
- **Estimated Timeline**: 8-12 months for complete mastery

## 🎯 Mastery Criteria (Per Topic)
- [ ] **Pattern Recognition** - Identify approach in 2-3 minutes
- [ ] **Implementation Speed** - Code solution in 10-15 minutes
- [ ] **Optimization Skills** - Know multiple approaches & trade-offs
- [ ] **Edge Case Handling** - Handle all corner cases
- [ ] **Complexity Analysis** - Accurate time/space analysis

## 🚀 How to Use This Roadmap
1. **Focus on One Topic** - Complete entire topic before moving
2. **Follow Topic README** - Each has detailed progression plan
3. **Track Progress** - Check off problems as you complete
4. **Review Regularly** - Revisit previous topics weekly
5. **Practice Consistently** - 1-2 problems daily minimum

## 🏆 Current Focus
**Arrays Mastery** - Working through 75+ array problems to build strong foundation.
